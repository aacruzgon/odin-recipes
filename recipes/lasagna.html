    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering wide flat pasta sheets with rich meat sauce, creamy béchamel (or ricotta-based cheese mixture), and shredded cheese, typically mozzarella and Parmesan. To prepare it, begin by cooking a meat sauce—usually ground beef or pork sautéed with onions and garlic—then simmer it with crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, and Italian herbs like oregano and basil. In parallel, prepare the béchamel by melting butter, whisking in flour to make a roux, then gradually adding milk to form a smooth, thick sauce. Alternatively, a mixture of ricotta cheese, egg, and spinach is used in some regional or vegetarian variations.
    </p>
    <p>To assemble, spread a layer of sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, then add a layer of lasagna noodles (boiled or oven-ready), followed by more sauce, a layer of béchamel or ricotta, and a sprinkle of shredded cheese. Repeat these layers, finishing with a generous topping of cheese. The lasagna is then baked at around 375°F (190°C) for 40–50 minutes until the top is golden and bubbling. After resting for about 10–15 minutes to set, it’s ready to be sliced and served.</p>
